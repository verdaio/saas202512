### Task 7: CLAUDE.md Configuration

**What was done:**
User requested update of template placeholders in CLAUDE.md to actual project values. Updated all placeholders and fixed file references to match actual documentation structure.

**How it was implemented:**
- Replaced template placeholders:
  - `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` → `saas202512`
  - `{{MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED}}` → `true`
  - `{{TENANT_MODEL}}` → `subdomain`
  - `{{CREATION_DATE}}` → `2025-11-02` (initially incorrect as 2025-01-06, fixed later)
  - `{{PROJECT_PORT_FRONTEND}}` → `3012`
- Fixed file references:
  - `DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md` → `docs/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md`
  - `STYLE-GUIDE.md` → `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`
  - `TESTING-CHECKLIST.md` → `docs/TESTING-GUIDE.md`
- Removed duplicate template files from root directory

## Problems Encountered

### Issue 1: PDF Text Truncation

**Problem:** User's technical review feedback was getting truncated when pasted in a single message due to length.

**Solution:** Asked user to break feedback into smaller chunks. Successfully received all feedback in 2-3 segments and processed completely.

**Lessons learned:** For long text input, proactively suggest breaking into chunks to avoid truncation issues.

### Issue 2: Incorrect Creation Date

**Problem:** Initially used 2025-01-06 as creation date in ADRs and CLAUDE.md instead of actual date 2025-11-02.

**Solution:** User caught the error. Corrected dates across all 5 files (4 ADRs + CLAUDE.md) and committed fix.

**Lessons learned:** Always verify dates against environment info before using in documentation. Don't carry over dates from templates without validation.

### Issue 3: Duplicate Template Files

**Problem:** Found 3 template files (DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md, STYLE-GUIDE.md, TESTING-CHECKLIST.md) in project root that were never customized and conflicted with actual docs in `docs/` directory.

**Solution:** Deleted the duplicate template files from root. Actual documentation exists in `docs/` with proper naming (DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, TESTING-GUIDE.md).

**Lessons learned:** Clean up template files during setup if they're not being used, to avoid confusion about which files are authoritative.

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Complete Build Approach (vs. MVP-First)

**Context:** User provided comprehensive viability summary with 6 well-defined MVP areas. All features appear essential for launch (scheduling, payments, SMS, vaccinations, no-show defense, ops tools).

**Options considered:**
1. MVP-First - Build iteratively, ship smallest viable version first
2. Complete Build - Build all 6 MVP areas before beta launch (60-90 days)

**Decision:** Complete Build approach chosen based on:
- Small, well-defined scope (6 MVP areas mapped to 6 sprints)
- All features essential for core value proposition
- User has validated concept (detailed viability analysis complete)
- Timeline is manageable: 12 weeks for solo founder
- Beta goal is specific: 20 shops, not mass market launch

**Trade-offs:**
- **Gained:** Complete product at beta launch, all differentiators working, professional impression
- **Lost:** Longer time to first user feedback, higher risk if assumptions are wrong, no iterative validation

### Decision 2: Subdomain-Based Multi-Tenancy

**Context:** Each pet care business needs their own branded experience while sharing infrastructure for cost efficiency.

**Options considered:**
1. Subdomain-based (happypaws.petcare.app)
2. Path-based (petcare.app/happypaws)
3. Separate databases per tenant

**Decision:** Subdomain-based with shared database and row-level security (documented in ADR-004).

**Trade-offs:**
- **Gained:** Professional branding, simple tenant resolution, low infrastructure cost
- **Lost:** Subdomain conflicts possible, DNS dependency, testing complexity

## Key Takeaways

### What Went Well
1. **PDF integration:** Successfully extracted complete viability summary and structured it into actionable planning docs
2. **Comprehensive planning:** Created 23 documentation files covering all aspects of the project (planning, development, architecture, operations)
3. **User feedback loop:** User provided detailed technical review which significantly improved developer documentation quality
4. **Complete Build approach:** Clear scope and timeline (6 sprints × 2 weeks = 12 weeks) makes project manageable
5. **Multi-tenant foundation:** Documented security-critical architecture decisions early (RLS, subdomain model, secrets management)

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Date accuracy:** Should have verified creation date against environment info before using in templates
2. **Template cleanup:** Could have proactively removed unused template files during setup
3. **Chunking strategy:** Could have asked user upfront to break long feedback into chunks to avoid truncation

### Lessons Learned
1. **Complete Build is viable for small, well-defined projects:** When scope is clear and all features are essential, Complete Build can work for solo founders within 60-90 days
2. **User review is invaluable:** The technical feedback improved docs significantly (Docker v2 requirements, secrets management, generated files policy)
3. **Documentation debt compounds:** Creating comprehensive docs upfront (even before code) prevents confusion and rework during development
4. **ADRs capture context:** Recording architectural decisions now (when context is fresh) will prevent "why did we choose this?" questions later
