# OKRs - Q1 2025

**Period:** January 6 - March 31, 2025
**Owner:** Chris Stephens
**Status:** Planning
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-02

---

## Company Vision & Strategy

**Vision:** Become the de facto scheduling standard for pet care professionals by delivering what incumbents miss: SMS-first workflows, impossible-to-double-book safeguards, and integrated vaccination lifecycle management.

**This Quarter's Focus:** Complete Build → Beta Launch → Validation

Build all 6 MVP areas in 60-90 days, launch with 20 beta shops, and validate our core hypotheses: SMS-first workflows reduce no-shows, double-booking prevention wins market share, and smooth migration drives adoption.

---

## Objective 1: Ship Production-Ready MVP

**Why this matters:** We're executing a Complete Build approach - all 6 MVP areas must be functional before beta launch. Shipping a robust, bug-free product builds trust with early adopters and validates our technical approach.

### Key Result 1.1: Complete all 6 sprint deliverables on schedule
- **Target:** 100% completion of all sprint goals (Sprint 1-6) by March 14, 2025
- **Current:** 0% (not started)
- **Progress:** 0% 🔵
- **Owner:** Chris Stephens
- **Confidence:** Medium (solo founder capacity risk)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Sprint 1: Multi-tenant foundation, core models, auth system
- ✅ Sprint 2: Scheduling engine with double-booking prevention
- ✅ Sprint 3: Booking widget, Stripe payments, SMS reminders
- ✅ Sprint 4: Vaccination tracking, no-show defense
- ✅ Sprint 5: Two-way SMS inbox, quick actions
- ✅ Sprint 6: Ops dashboard, reporting, beta onboarding

**Progress Updates:**
- 2025-11-02: Planning complete, sprint plans created, ready to start Sprint 1

### Key Result 1.2: Achieve zero critical bugs before beta launch
- **Target:** 0 critical bugs (P0 issues blocking core workflows)
- **Current:** N/A (not built yet)
- **Progress:** 0% 🔵
- **Owner:** Chris Stephens
- **Confidence:** High (thorough testing planned)

**Testing Requirements:**
- End-to-end booking flow: 10+ test scenarios
- Multi-tenant isolation: Verified with 3 test tenants
- Payment processing: Tested deposits, refunds, fees
- SMS delivery: 95%+ delivery rate
- Scheduling conflicts: Stress tested (100 concurrent bookings, zero double-books)

**Progress Updates:**
- 2025-11-02: Test plan to be created in Sprint 6

### Key Result 1.3: Deploy to production with 99.5%+ uptime
- **Target:** Production environment live, monitored, 99.5% uptime Week 12-13
- **Current:** 0% (no production environment yet)
- **Progress:** 0% 🔵
- **Owner:** Chris Stephens
- **Confidence:** High (infrastructure planned)

**Infrastructure:**
- Hosting: AWS/Heroku/DigitalOcean (TBD Sprint 1)
- Database: Managed PostgreSQL
- File storage: S3 or equivalent
- Monitoring: Uptime checks, error tracking (Sentry)
- Backups: Automated daily

**Progress Updates:**
- 2025-11-02: Infrastructure decisions in Sprint 1

---

## Objective 2: Launch Successful Beta Program

**Why this matters:** Beta validates product-market fit, surfaces issues before public launch, and generates case studies for marketing. 20 shops is enough to stress-test the system while remaining manageable for solo support.

### Key Result 2.1: Enroll 20 beta shops by March 31
- **Target:** 20 active beta shops onboarded and using the product
- **Current:** 0
- **Progress:** 0% 🔵
- **Owner:** Chris Stephens
- **Confidence:** Medium (dependent on outreach and product readiness)

**Beta Recruitment Tactics:**
- Direct outreach: 100 local pet care businesses (mobile groomers, solo trainers)
- Partner channels: Grooming schools, van upfitters, Facebook groups
- Personal network: Leverage existing contacts
- Incentive: Free for 3 months + priority feature requests

**Qualification Criteria:**
- Must be mobile groomer, solo trainer, or small salon (1-3 tables)
- Willing to migrate from current tool
- Commit to 60-minute onboarding call

- Test for full 4 weeks minimum

**Progress Updates:**
- 2025-11-02: Beta recruitment to start Week 13 (March 17)

### Key Result 2.2: Achieve 60% beta shop activation rate
- **Target:** 12 of 20 beta shops actively using product (3+ bookings/week)
- **Current:** 0
- **Progress:** 0% 🔵
- **Owner:** Chris Stephens
- **Confidence:** Medium (dependent on product quality and support)

**Active Usage Definition:**
- Minimum 3 appointments booked per week
- SMS reminders sent and delivered
- At least 1 payment processed
- Staff logging in daily

**Support Plan:**
- Daily check-ins first week
- Weekly check-ins after that
- Dedicated support email/SMS

### Key Result 2.3: Migrate beta shops in <60 minutes average
- **Target:** Average onboarding time <60 minutes (from signup to first booking)
- **Current:** N/A (not launched)
- **Progress:** 0% 🔵
- **Owner:** Chris Stephens
- **Confidence:** High (onboarding wizard designed for speed)

**Onboarding Wizard (5 Steps):**
1. Business Profile (10 min)
2. Services Setup (15 min)
3. Resources & Staff (10 min)
4. Import Existing Data (20 min) - includes CSV import
5. Integrations (5 min) - Stripe + Twilio

**Migration Support:**
- CSV import templates provided
- Video walkthrough available
- Live onboarding calls optional
- Weekend migration support (minimize disruption)

**Progress Updates:**
- 2025-11-02: Onboarding wizard to be built in Sprint 6

## Objective 3: Validate Core Product Hypotheses

**Why this matters:** Beta phase is for validation, not just bug-fixing. We must prove our differentiators actually solve the pain points we identified: no-shows, double-bookings, and manual work.

### Key Result 3.1: Reduce no-shows by ≥30% vs. beta shop baselines
- **Target:** 30% reduction in no-show rate for beta shops (comparing to their pre-Pet Care baseline)
- **Current:** N/A (no baseline yet)
- **Progress:** 0% 🔵
- **Owner:** Chris Stephens
- **Confidence:** Medium-High (SMS reminders proven effective in market research)

**Baseline Collection:**
- Ask beta shops for last 3 months no-show rate during onboarding
- Track Pet Care no-show rate weekly
- Compare after 4 weeks of usage

**Success Drivers:**
- SMS confirmations (24hr + 2hr reminders)
- Deposit requirements (card-on-file)
- Cancellation policies enforced
- Waitlist autofill

**Progress Updates:**
- 2025-11-02: No-show tracking to be built in Sprint 6 reporting

### Key Result 3.2: Achieve 70%+ booking confirmation rate
- **Target:** 70% of bookings confirmed via SMS (owners reply "C" or tap link)
- **Current:** N/A
- **Progress:** 0% 🔵
- **Owner:** Chris Stephens
- **Confidence:** Medium (depends on SMS engagement)

**Measurement:**
- Track SMS reminder sends
- Track confirmation responses (keyword "C", click confirmation link)
- Calculate confirmation rate = confirmations / total reminders sent

**Success Factors:**
- Clear SMS copy ("Reply C to confirm")
- Easy one-tap confirmation link
- Sent at optimal times (24hr and 2hr before)

**Progress Updates:**
- 2025-11-02: SMS tracking to be built in Sprint 3 & 5

### Key Result 3.3: Zero double-bookings reported in beta
- **Target:** 0 double-booking incidents in 4-week beta period
- **Current:** N/A
- **Progress:** 0% 🔵
- **Owner:** Chris Stephens
- **Confidence:** High (core differentiator, heavily tested)

**Validation:**
- Stress test with 100 concurrent booking attempts (Sprint 2)
- Beta shops explicitly asked to test edge cases
- Incident reporting form for any scheduling conflicts
- Daily monitoring of appointment overlaps

**"Impossible to Double-Book" Features:**
- Resource locking (database-level)
- Buffer time enforcement
- Conflict detection before booking
- Real-time availability checking

**Progress Updates:**
- 2025-11-02: Scheduling engine to be built and tested in Sprint 2
